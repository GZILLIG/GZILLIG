- 👋 Hi, I’m Gabriel!
- 👀 Did some Arduino projects in the past (will upload them soon), but right now I'm more focused in web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Front-End basics (HTML, CSS, JS). The next step will be React and Angular.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in front-end projects to add up some experience!
